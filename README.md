## [API Documentation](https://github.com/pbojinov/nodeifications/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki

## Getting Started

1. Include the javascript `nw-desktop-notifications.js` in your application

2. Include the HTML template `nw-desktop-notifications.html` in your application

3. Create a notification using the API: `DEA.notifications.create(options, callback);`

## Running the demo

(1) Clone this project

(2) cd into the project /src

(3) Make the nw zip file by running the bash script

	./make-nw.sh

(4) Run the nw application

	node-webkit desktop-notify.nw

## Building for Production

From the root of the project:

	npm install

	grunt build

Then run the executable/app from /webkitbuilds/release/NW Desktop Notifications Demo

## Application Flow

1. Call the API to create a new notification.

2. `nw-desktop-notifications.js` creates the HTML template using the user provided content

3. `nw-desktop-notifications.js` created the notification and appends the template to the created notification window.

4. `nw-desktop-notifications.html` is simply the container for the content. It handles closing itself and sending off interaction events back to the parent who initiated the notification.
